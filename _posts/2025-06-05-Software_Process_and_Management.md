### Q2

Question2: Earned Value Management in a Mobile App Development Project3
(Total Marks: 10)
You are the project manager of a 10-week mobile app development project with a total budget (BAC) of $100,000. The work is divided into 5 phases:

|Phase	|Planned % of Total Work|	Planned Duration (weeks)|
|-|-|-|
|Requirements Analysis|	10%|	1|
|UI/UX Design	|20%	|2|
|Backend Development|	30%|	3|
|Frontend Development|	25%|	2|
|Testing & Deployment|	15%|	2|

At the end of Week 5, the following progress and costs are reported:

-	Actual Cost (AC) = $55,000
-	Work completed = 40%
-	Planned % of work by end of Week 5 = 60%

Tasks:
1.	Calculate the Earned Value (EV). (2 marks)
2.	Calculate the Estimate at Completion (EAC) assuming current cost performance continues. (3 marks)
3.	Calculate the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and estimate the revised project duration based on it. (3 marks)
4.	Comment on the project’s current cost and schedule status. (2 marks)

Hint:
-	EV = % of actual work completed × BAC
-	EAC = BAC / CPI
-	SPI = EV / PV

移动应用开发项目中的挣值管理（EVM）

你是一个为期 **10 周**的移动应用开发项目的项目经理，**总预算（BAC）为 \$100,000**。工作被分为如下 5 个阶段：

| 阶段      | 计划工作百分比 | 计划持续时间（周） |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| 需求分析    | 10%     | 1         |
| UI/UX设计 | 20%     | 2         |
| 后端开发    | 30%     | 3         |
| 前端开发    | 25%     | 2         |
| 测试与部署   | 15%     | 2         |

截至**第5周末**，报告如下：

* 实际成本（AC）= \$55,000
* 实际完成工作量 = 40%
* 截至第5周，计划完成工作比例 = 60%


#### 1. 计算挣值 EV（2分）

> 📌 **公式：**

$$
EV = BAC × 实际完成百分比
$$

> 📌 **代入计算：**

$$
EV = \$100,000 × 40\% = \$40,000
$$

✅ **答：** 挣值 EV = **\$40,000**

---

#### 2. 计算完工估算 EAC（假设当前成本效率持续）（3分）

> 📌 **公式（EAC 以 CPI 为基础）：**

$$
EAC = \frac{BAC}{CPI} = \frac{BAC × AC}{EV}
$$

> 📌 先求 CPI（成本绩效指数）：

$$
CPI = \frac{EV}{AC} = \frac{40,000}{55,000} ≈ 0.727
$$

> 📌 再代入计算：

$$
EAC = \frac{100,000}{0.727} ≈ 137,500
$$

✅ **答：** 完工估算 EAC ≈ **\$137,500**

---

#### 3. 计算 SPI（进度绩效指数）并估算调整后的项目周期（3分）

> 📌 **公式（SPI）：**

$$
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}
$$

> PV = BAC × 计划完成百分比 = \$100,000 × 60% = \$60,000

$$
SPI = \frac{EV}{PV} = \frac{40,000}{60,000} = 0.667
$$

> 📌 **调整后的项目工期：**

$$
预计工期 = \frac{原工期}{SPI} = \frac{10}{0.667} ≈ 15 周
$$

✅ **答：**

* SPI = **0.667**
* 调整后的项目周期 ≈ **15 周**

---

#### 4. 项目当前的成本与进度状态评论（2分）

✅ **成本状况：**

* **CPI < 1**，说明单位工作成本超支 → 项目 **超预算**。

✅ **进度状况：**

* **SPI < 1**，说明工作进度落后 → 项目 **延期**。

📝 **总结：**

> 项目当前既 **超预算**又 **进度延迟**，如按现有趋势继续，将需更多资金和时间完成。

### Q3
Question3:Application-Based Scrum 

You have been hired as the Scrum Master for a tech startup building a food delivery mobile app. The team includes front-end and back-end developers, a Product Owner, UX designers, and QA testers. The app is expected to go live in four months. Stakeholders are pushing for faster releases, while the team is struggling with unclear user stories and repeated changes during the sprint.

Write a detailed essay explaining how you would apply Scrum principles and practices to:
1.	Structure the roles and responsibilities within the Scrum team
2.	Manage and prioritize a dynamic Product Backlog
3.	Facilitate effective Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Retrospective
4.	Deal with frequent mid-sprint change requests
5.	Improve team performance and stakeholder collaboration over time
Support your answer with specific tools (e.g., burndown chart, definition of done, backlog refinement) and real-world practices from similar agile projects.

问题 3：基于应用程序的 Scrum
您已被聘为一家科技初创公司的 Scrum Master，该公司正在构建一个送餐移动应用程序。该团队包括前端和后端开发人员、产品负责人、UX 设计师和 QA 测试人员。该应用程序预计将在四个月后上线。利益相关者正在推动更快的发布，而团队则在冲刺期间努力解决不明确的用户故事和重复更改的问题。
写一篇详细的文章，解释如何将 Scrum 原则和实践应用于：
1. 构建 Scrum 团队中的角色和职责
2. 管理动态产品待办列表并确定其优先级
3. 促进有效的 Sprint 计划、每日 Scrums、Sprint 回顾和回顾
4. 处理频繁的 Sprint 中期变更请求
5. 随着时间的推移提高团队绩效和利益相关者协作
使用特定工具（例如，燃尽图、完成定义、积压工作细化）和类似敏捷项目中的实际实践来支持您的答案。

🔹 1. Scrum Roles and Responsibilities
-	Product Owner (PO): Owns the Product Backlog, prioritizes features such as live tracking, payment gateway integration, and restaurant onboarding.
-	Scrum Master: Facilitates Scrum ceremonies, removes blockers, shields team from distractions, and coaches on agile best practices.
-	Development Team: Cross-functional members who design, build, test, and deliver a potentially shippable product increment each sprint.
Application: I would clarify each role during kickoff and revisit responsibilities in retrospectives when confusion arises.
________________________________________
🔹 2. Managing and Prioritizing the Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is dynamic and should reflect evolving priorities.
-	I would schedule regular backlog refinement sessions (at least once per sprint).
-	Use techniques like MoSCoW or Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) to help the PO prioritize.
-	Ensure backlog items are broken down into INVEST-compliant user stories (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).
Example: "As a user, I want to track my order live so I can know when to be ready."
________________________________________
🔹 3. Facilitating Scrum Ceremonies
-	Sprint Planning:
Team selects backlog items and defines the Sprint Goal. I’d ensure only refined items are selected to prevent confusion during development.
-	Daily Scrum:
15-minute stand-up where team members discuss progress, plans, and blockers. As Scrum Master, I’d coach the team to keep it focused.
-	Sprint Review:
Stakeholders review the increment. I’d help the team present demos that align with the sprint goal.
-	Sprint Retrospective:
Discuss what went well, what didn’t, and actionable improvements. I’d encourage psychological safety for open feedback.
Example: After a sprint with delayed testing, we might agree to shift one developer to pair with QA mid-sprint next time.
________________________________________
🔹 4. Dealing with Mid-Sprint Change Requests
Scrum discourages changes mid-sprint unless urgent.
-	I’d coach the PO and stakeholders to channel new requests into the Product Backlog and prioritize them for the next sprint.
-	If change is unavoidable, I’d facilitate a conversation between PO and team to cancel or revise the current sprint if needed (as per Scrum Guide).
Example: A request to add a wallet feature mid-sprint would be deferred unless it blocks a critical path.
________________________________________
🔹 5. Improving Team Performance and Stakeholder Collaboration
-	Implement a Definition of Done (DoD) to ensure clarity in deliverables.
-	Use Velocity charts and Burndown charts to help forecast future sprints and measure team capacity.
-	Encourage direct PO-user feedback loops via beta testing groups.
-	Foster team ownership by rotating demo presenters and encouraging cross-functional pairing.
Long-term: As the team matures, I would gradually reduce interventions, allowing them to self-organize and deliver consistently.
